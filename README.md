The challenge is to detect partial discharge patterns in signals acquired from these power lines with a new meter designed at the ENET Centre at VÅ B. Effective classifiers using this data will make it possible to continuously monitor power lines for faults.

The different approaches were implamented to solve this problem. FFT features and time-series statistics were used as an input for the models like LightGBM, LSTM and TCN.
